**VERSION 1**: [https://github.com/thomasgilmore95/netflix-clone](https://github.com/thomasgilmore95/netflix-clone)

I created a Netflix Clone Version 2 using React and [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

I use The Movie Database to fetch the movie images and posters to populate in the Netflix Clone.

One of the bigger changes between version 1 and version 2 is that version 1 I use React Class Component and in version 2 I switched to React Functional Component.
